	NOTE: Some of the table customizations have been moved to ConVars, meaning you can change them through the server console.
	If you wish to have all of the configs in this file and don't want them as ConVars, download the version from the old branch here: https://github.com/LambdaGaming/Crafting_System/tree/old
