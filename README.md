This is a simple, yet highly customizable crafting table made to work with all gamemodes. Below are it's current features.
<ul>
  <li>Not hard coded to accept specific entities like other crafting systems.</li>
  <li>Accepts any entity as an ingredient and/or craftable item. (As long as the item is configured correctly.)</li>
  <li>Customizable sounds. Includes button click, successful craft, missing ingredients, missing spawn function, and placing and item on the table.</li>
  <li>Customizable UI colors. Includes window background color, button color, and text color. Might make window size customizable at some point as well.</li>
  <li>Customizable table appearance. Includes model, material, and color.</li>
  <li>Customizable health. Includes adjustable max health and whether or not the table should explode when it's health reaches 0.</li>
  <li>Cuztomizable item spawn function. (Which basically means you can code what happens when the player selects to craft a specific item without having to dig through the table's code.)</li>
</ul>
